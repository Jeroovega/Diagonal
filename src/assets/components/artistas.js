Fast-forward to 2021 and Lindsey has truly become a recognized name in her city and beyond, in large part thanks to her unique signature sets— true journeys that explore alternating soundscapes laced together by dark, deep and heavy textures, as well psychedelic elements and ethereal melodies; and now her productions as well. With tour dates that have brought her to international venues playing beside top name DJs, she is an artist to watch.

        Lindsey’s hard work over the years has paid off, gaining her residencies with San Francisco’s Robot Ears for six years, and more recently becoming the newest member of Direct to Earth in SF, as well as earning a spot on the roster of Berlin-based agency, Point Collective back in 2016. She has played coveted gigs in Detroit, Chicago, Athens, Istanbul, and throughout Germany, as well as her recent debut in the legendary Tresor Berlin and Gate Club in Batumi, Georgia.
        
        Lindsey’s debut in the production realm was in September 2018 with a remix of Martyn Päsch’s track ‘Sacred’ on KVLTÖ Records. Her debut solo EP was released in 2019 on LA-based label Ascetic Limited with a remix from Motionen. Her latest releases came out between late 2020-present and consisted of her single ‘Lucid’ on NECHTO Records, ‘Dark Matter’ on Planet X, ‘Vertigo’ on Rave Code, ‘Until We Meet Again’ + a remix of Gabriella Vergilov’s ‘The Love Anthem’ on Chicago’s Northern Parallels, a remix of BRÄLLE's 'Feathers for Bones' on Märked Amsterdam, a remix of Motion Symmetry’s ‘Aquarius’ on No Way Records + a remix of Kota Kira’s ‘Candlelight’ on Re:Mission Entertainment.

        bio: `U.R Trax delivers eclectic DJ performances defending a diverse sound, de facto made by diverse profiles of artists. From trippy techno to rough and cold electro and “backroom” dark trance, U.R. Trax advocates “immersive music for the mind”. Her first language was music. Drummer since her very tender childhood, she started producing in her early teenage years and focused herself a few years later on Techno. In 2020, she releases her first record “Folge Mir” on Hector Oaks KAOS. In 2021, she released her debut EP “Moral Krisis” on the sub-label she was given: “KAOS-URTRAX”. Her early tracks have been tinted with a classic-driving techno sound. However, her release on Nina Kraviz’ trip (Atom Heart) marks a more psychedelic turn, and her single “Br0ken” on Ellen Alien’s BPitch announces a wider range of sonic experiments for the future.`,

        bio: `Influenced by the literature of Dante Alighieri in his work the Divine Comedy, as well as everything related to history, Vendex comes with the intention of creating a path to an inner journey wrapped in dark melodies, blunt and sharp bass that defy the natural, reaching supernatural sounds that touch or even reach what would be the sound of the underworld. Generating sounds that guide the Dantesque idea of a trip to the underworld, with the aim of reaching paradise. All this through a forceful and enveloping sound, thus creating a path to the nine levels of hell, purgatory, and finally reaching paradise.`,

        DJ, label owner, live-act and former mastering engineer, Wallis speaks for a generation searching for novelty in the techno realm. Sharp engineering skills coupled with a unique approach to sound design allowed her to develop a trademark sound, that regularly allows fans to recognize a “Wallis track” even before it is released. Using an array of synthesizers, effects units, and experimental studio techniques, Wallis produces confrontational and urgent techno that shifts constantly between different patterns and atmospheres. She launched her own label, Jell, and has released several times on Kobosil’s label R Label Group or been part of compilations in many other renowned labels such as Ellen Allien’s label Bpitch or remixed Perc. A promising newcomer of the techno scene, a studio head as well as a prolific touring artist, she can play massive stages like Awakenings or DGTL one day and play in a intimate sweaty basement the following day.`,
