        bio: `Strongly shaped by the raw and forward-leaning sound of 90’s Techno, Milan based artist Alarico Zucchi started his journey into electronic music in 2015 making his way through clubs as a DJ while learning the art of music production.
        The inauguration of ‘Alarico’ occurred in 2019 after previously exploring several sub-genres of Techno. The alias was formed as a statement to showcase a style that was personal to him. Personal in a way that he became captivated within the patterns and structures of his own sound.
        Known for fast paced rhythms and kinky grooves he has released music consistently since his debut in 2020 on Joton’s imprint ‘Newrhytmic Records’. Shortly after he launched the vinyl imprint “Katana Records” which showcases the more nose-bleed and mental side of his idea of Techno. 
        Also 2021 so far has been a prolific key year for Alarico. While the world fell seemingly more and more asleep, he continued honing his craft: His debut on Amsterdam based label ‘OOM Records’ was followed by an invitation on Matrixxman’s ‘The Grid’ and SHDW & Obscure Shape’s new label ‘Mutual Rytm’.
        Alarico continues to position himself as a unique music lover, continuing to explore the depths and possibilities of sound. He stands for continuously pushing boundaries and stirring this attitude with his background of Hip Hop and Japanese culture.`

        bio: `Despite playing her first gig in 2016, Cera has been smashing dance floors all around the globe.
        Raised in Tunisia & currently based in Berlin, Cera plays “Whatever the fuck she wants” from industrial hardcore techno, mind bending acid, fast hard trance and even gabber. Her sets release a transcendental energy that makes everyone desire more right after.
        In her latest interview she explains: “My mission as a DJ is to share the music I love with the people and make them lose their shit and forget all their worries. For me, playing music and energising people goes hand in hand. I’m here to entertain people and have grat time all together. I also like dancing a lot, I literally can’t stand behind the booth without dancing and I need to sync my body moves with music to keep up the pace. I guess i’m also quite empathetic so it’s easy for me to read a crowd and understand what vibe I should go for.
        Her debut Vinyl EP is now out on her own label LazyTapes. *Demons to Some Angels to Others EP* is probably an extension of her personality, she plays with dualites in a completely fearless manner. Between horror & euphoria Cera Khin found her sweet spot.
        Cera Khin is also a self empowerment & mental healt warrior. She is the founder of the instagram account “Technomentalhealt” in wich she has been breaking stigmas and spreading awareness about mental healt in the electronic music industry.
        With her bold approach to Techno, her boundless energy and her forward looking taste in music. Cera Khin is an unapologetic star of the hard dance music era.

        His record label – Clergy, has been a staple of the scene since early 2015. Releasing over 30 EPs, Clergy has  continuously establishing some of the scenes most recent talent to date. With the unique vision and creative output, the label has been able to stand out independently. More recently Jorden has started showcasing a new project  under the alias Azrael [aka Cleric]. Focusing on a more  high paced groove and soulful influence. Also being  paired with a live percussionist, this other side serves  as a perfect balance to that relentless sound we are used  to from Cleric.

        bio: `Contrast. Objection. Antithesis. This is how you might start an attempt to describe the world. A seemingly chaos of shapes and thoughts that don’t belong to each other. An overall image to be found in life and in music. But that’s not Fiedel’s view of the world. Where others make distinctions, he sees connections, where others find emptiness, he finds rooms full of opportunities.
        Finding those harmonies, connections and contexts marks out his musical work. The synthesis of apparently opposing music, the interaction and the mix of styles and moods, without loosing the storyline, that makes out the characteristic Fiedel sound.After the wall came down, the way was open to access a fresh scene, and with it came a whole spectrum of new and old music to discover. In the beginning of the 1990s, he started DJing in public as a regular at the Monday events at Subversiv. Shortly after he began his collaboration with his befriended Errorsmith under the name of MMM. They released several productions and play live shows. Since 2000 he is resident at OstGut and later on at Berghain. On the compilation Fünf he had his first solo release on the incorporated Ostgut Ton label, followed by contributions to the compilations Various (2013) and Ostgut Ton | Zehn (2015). In 2012 he eventually founded his own label Fiedelone, to give his own productions a more personal base. In spring 2014 he developed a live set, which he premiered at Berghain. March 2017 saw his first full Ostgut Ton release with the 12″ Substance B, followed up by his contribution to the Berghain mixes series in January 2018.You can say one thing about Fiedel: he is no techno or house stereotype pattern, that you can put randomly on a every evening or club. He is lead by his history, the history of the music and the feeling of the moment to build something new and to capture this very moment. Let it be the straight dark techno of today, banging acid of the 80ies or an electro funk record, Fiedel surprises. He undermines and overrides expectations and refrains to limit the music for any reason. He lets the music speak for itself, through himself.

        bio: `As the resident DJ of Grounded Theory, one of its founders, curator of its celebrated events, and a DJ of worldwide renown for ability and tastes, Henning Baer forged his enviable résumé with his own hands. Since its beginning in 2009, Grounded Theory has grown from a bracing new idea in Berlin techno to an institution of artistic nightlife both at its home and around the continent. Directed with acute vision and unerring judgment, its philosophy extracted from Henning’s long years at the front lines of electronic music, it remains diverse and cutting edge. Mirroring Henning Baer's DJ sets, Grounded Theory combines music from different eras and areas, remaining rooted in techno while shedding light on sounds less frequently heard on Berlin dance floors: forward UK music, experimental electronics, and underground techno names from across the globe, both new and established.  Henning Baer is asserting greater independence with innovative new production styles on a recent EP for Taanstaafl Planets. The launch of his own MANHIGH imprint buttresses the foundation of his own work, to be built up alongside a select few whose productions meet the curatorial acumen of one of techno’s finest ears. After esteemed releases on Sonic Groove, K209 and elsewhere, fans worldwide have much to look forward to from a label whose standards match those of Grounded Theory. Already a respected artist, Henning’s diligence has transported him from the counter to the shelves of Hardwax and from the floor to the booth of Berghain in regular appearances. Now he is building further upon these impressive accomplishments, profoundly shaping contemporary techno from recent memory into the foreseeable future.`,

Soaking up everything that catches them, whether it’s rhythmic elements, melody or even just moods within a song. The underlying key element of everything they touch is groove and swing, as Narciss has proved time and time again: They understand what makes people move physically and emotionally.Claiming influences from pretty much a dozen genres from all angles of the spectrum makes them an absolute experience to witness behind the decks. Don’t make the mistake to dive in with expectations about the musical direction they might take – Narciss will shatter them anyway. What you can expect however is an energy of overboarding joy paired with body-moving grooves, putting smiles on anyone in the vicinity. Appearing first and continuously on the Leipzig-output Seelen Records shows the importance of labels that hand musical freedom over to Narciss – just let them do their thing and you can rest easy.`,

        nombre: "RADICAL SOFTNESS",
        bio: `Radical Softness, a name which, at first sight, seems controversial and yet has a very much deeper meaning. Being a somewhat radical person when it comes to vouching for values such as the right of self expression, establishment of safer spaces and FLINTA visibility in the scene. On the other hand being a radical person stands and falls with the softest part of any human – the inner self. Without emotion and passion, there will never be the radicality and drive for change that is needed. Radical Softness stands for change with all their actions, activism, positivity and drive.On the musical side of the coin, Radical Softness immediately evokes a sense of warmth and force at the same time, which again represents the artistic direction of the name itself. Powerful rhythmic patterns go hand in hand with mellow synths – together on a mission to invite dancers to reach the subconscious in an almost therapeutic way. Radical Softness introduces repetition to you as the means to escape daily sorrows, to feel again and gain a few hours of freedom from a seemingly fast-paced and cold outside world.
        Being a music lover is probably the uniting attribute of all DJs, but where the wheat really gets separated from the chaff is the interest in going deeper than just scraping the surface. Radical Softness’ desire to be a DJ already subconsciously began in 2013 when they started working at a local bar, where they quickly became the one in charge of the music playlists. This marks the beginning of following a path down the rabbit hole into a new universe and into digging through artists entire discographies. Their move to Berlin in 2015 further shaped their vision of music. By that time Radical Softness was already asking people in their circle to show them how to DJ, but never felt welcome enough to actually dive head first into the blue. In 2019 the switch luckily flicked, they stepped behind the decks, quickly gained recognition, especially through their well-received sets on HÖR Berlin and combined their deep music collection with the ability to quickly grasp how DJing works from the core. And yet, what we hear right now is just the beginning of what Radical Softness has to offer.`,

        bio: `Launching their collaborative career in 2014, SHDW & Obscure Shape, otherwise known as Marco Bläsi and Luigi Urban, are at the forefront of a new generation of artists leading the resurgence of timeless techno. Presenting a maturity well beyond their years in both their production efforts and track selection, the duo have become firm favourites for the modern audience and yet still present as an untapped act, with the capacity to enter into the upper echelon of the beloved genre.
        Multifaceted in their approach and commitment to the circuit, the pair feel equal comfort running in underground circles and global events alike; testament to their unbridled creativity and mass appeal. Deserving reflection from fellow peers has ensured their elevation to even great heights in recent years, with their productions proving commonplace among the touring playlists of dance music’s elite.
        In 2015, the Stuttgart natives launched their first imprint From Another Mind, which came to fruition just one year after the birth of an event series under the same name. The FAM catalogue holds nine releases from its label heads to date, including the stand-out “Die Weiße Rose” EP; a four-tracker 12” which received critical acclaim from audiences and critics alike, and subsequently catapulted the duo into the next phase of their ongoing evolution. Two extensive remix compilations followed, with offerings from Rødhåd, Tale of Us, Dax J and James Ruskin to name a few. By 2016, Marco and Luigi had found their voice in the industry, with Groove Magazin selecting them as “Newcomers of the Year”. The accolade didn’t go unnoticed, as Rekid’s boss (Radio Slave) enlisted them for official remix duty on his track “Vision”, and later, his “Grindhouse” anthem. Earlier this year, the dyad celebrated the fifth anniversary of FAM with an extensive compilation album of SHDW & Obscure Shape productions. Titled “Versionen 008”, the anthology of re-works expressed the label’s vision to integrate contemporary sounds with vintage ideals, and featured an assortment of eclectic edits from the likes of Ø [Phase], Exium and Héctor Oaks, among others.
        Deeply influenced by the cardinal cuts of techno’s rich history, the self-confessed perfectionists harbor an extensive anthology of records dating back to the ‘90s, which functions as a continuous source of inspiration for their artistic vibrancy. With an insatiable appetite for knowledge and growth at the epicentre of their flourishing career, dance music’s impetuous progression is a welcomed challenge for the talents, who’s mantra remains, ‘an artist who no longer surprises his audience is no longer an artist’
        Now entering a new chapter in the SHDW & Obscure Shape saga, the duo prepare for the launch of their new imprint Mutual Rytm; their second venture within the label realm to date. The project will showcase a new dimension of scope for the pair who aim to channel the authentic perspectives of both established and up-and-coming talents through their platform. Navigating a new and diverse path for the electronic music landscape, the imprint will be a celebration of innovation, originality and diversity, with a focus on timeless cuts for the future development of house and techno. Continuing this same rich vein of form from behind the decks, the outfit welcomes a new residency at Fridas Pier, Stuttgart this year, which will no doubt act as a breeding ground for their panoramic and experimental strain of underground music.`,

Her early tracks have been tinted with a classic and driving techno sound.

INFLUENCED BY THE LITERATURE OF DANTE ALIGHIERI, AS WELL AS EVERYTHING RELATED TO HISTORY, VENDEX COMES WITH THE INTENTION TO CREATE A PASSAGE TO AN INNER JOURNEY WRAPPED IN DARK MELODIES, BLUNT AND SHARP BASS THAT DEFY THE NATURAL, REACHING SUPERNATURAL SOUNDS THAT TOUCH OR EVEN REACH WHAT WOULD BE THE SOUND OF THE UNDERWORLD.`,
