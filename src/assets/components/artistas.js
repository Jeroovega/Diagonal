The underlying key element of everything they touch is groove and swing, as Narciss has proved time and time again: They understand what makes people move physically and emotionally, making it an absolute experience to witness behind the decks. Don’t make the mistake of diving in with expectations about the musical direction they might take – Narciss will shatter them anyway. What you can expect however, is energy of over-boarding joy, paired with body-moving grooves, putting smiles on anyone in the vicinity. Appearing first on the Leipzig-output Seelen Records and subsequently joining London’s Lobster Theremin family, shows the importance of labels that hand musical freedom over to Narciss – just let them do their thing and you can rest easy.`,
